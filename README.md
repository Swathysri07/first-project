# Loan Defaulter Prediction
## Summary
I decided to showcase the data analysis and modeling sections of the project as part of my personal data science portfolio.The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict if a person will default on the loan based on the loan and personal information provided.It help make decisions on issuing loans, so that the risk can be lowered, and the profit can be maximized.
